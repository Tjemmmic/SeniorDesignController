# SeniorDesignController
Android controller and Python server used to control vehicle made for Senior Design Project

In this project, my team was tasked with designing and building an "Integrated Surface Vehicle". Some examples of the criteria are as follows:
  - Can be controlled via a Smartphone or Tablet
  - Can be monitored via a remote server (showing statistics such as GPS, Battery level, and other logs)
  - Is able to detect metal beneath the vehicle
  - Has the ability to pick up objects up to about 16 ounces
  - Can move over obstacles up to 6 inches in height

One of my tasks on this team was to design the android application that could be used to control the vehicle. The contents of this repository include my work.
